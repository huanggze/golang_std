type Response struct {
	// Body represents the response body.
	//
	// The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
	// is read. If the network connection fails or the server
	// terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
	//
	// The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
	// non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
	// a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
	// close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
	// reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
	// not read to completion and closed.
	//
	// The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
	// with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
	//
	// As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
	// on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
	// as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
	// value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
	// is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	ContentLength int64
	
	// Request is the request that was sent to obtain this Response.
	// Request's Body is nil (having already been consumed).
	// This is only populated for Client requests.
	Request *Request
